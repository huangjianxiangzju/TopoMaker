## A package to facilitate the MD simulation conducted by GROMACS. This package is developed by Institute of Quantitative Biology, Zhejiang University, China.

## We are trying to merge scripts to make a universal tools available.

## We are still on the first few steps to make more robust tools.

### Our mission is to create a comprehensive and robust library to build structures like linear polymers, branched polymers, solid materials, etc.
